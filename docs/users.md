# User Guide

## Getting started

1. Open RedTrack.
2. Add your backend URL, username, and password.
3. Select your server entry from the list.

## Main page

- **Add new server**: create a new saved backend profile.
- **Support**: use the Discord icon button to open the community support server.

## Dashboard

- View live player metrics and history.
- Use range controls (**Previous 3h**, **Next 3h**, **Now**) to navigate data windows.

## Connection loss handling

If RedTrack cannot reach the backend, a **Connection lost** screen appears instead of leaving a broken view.

- The app keeps retrying automatically in the background.
- You can also press **Retry now**.
- Once the backend is reachable again, the dashboard view returns automatically.
